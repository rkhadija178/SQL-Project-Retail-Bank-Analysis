# SQL-Project-Retail-Bank-Analysis
This project, "Retail Bank Customer Transaction Analysis," uses Python's Faker to generate realistic bank customer, account, and transaction data. SQL queries are then applied to analyze spending patterns, identify top customers, detect potential fraud, monitor account health, and create insightful reports for bank management.
